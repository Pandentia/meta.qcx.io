Yes, unfortunately we can't help you host everything. Things we disallow include:

- Anything against the rules of the `.io` registry (obviously).
- Illegal content, in your country or ours (Germany, Finland).
- Bigotry: Discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, sexuality, or the likes.

Please do [get in touch]({{< ref "about/contact.md" >}}) with us if you see any of these rules being broken.
