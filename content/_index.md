Hi, and welcome to `qcx.io`. This is an (effective) top-level domain, run in the spirit of anarchy. (Domains are provided [pay what you can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_can), for most intentions[\*]({{< ref "about/guidelines.md" >}}).)

Our guiding principle is that of giving a platform to the most marginalized of our society, but really, just about anything goes here (see above).

Currently, some of the things we provide domains for are:

- A number of personal domains
- File mirrors / code repositories

If you wish to join us (or contact us, for any reason), please do [get in touch]({{< ref "about/contact.md" >}})!
