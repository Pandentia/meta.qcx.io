Hi, and welcome to `qcx.io`. This is a top-level domain, run in the spirit of anarchy. (Domains are provided [pay what you can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_can), for any intention[\*]({{< ref "about/guidelines.md" >}})).

Currently, some of the things we provide domains for are:

- [Cassandra's build server](https://jenkins.pandentia.qcx.io)
- A number of personal domains
- File mirrors

If you wish to join us (or contact us, for any reason), please do [get in touch]({{< ref "about/contact.md" >}})!
